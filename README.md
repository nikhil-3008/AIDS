# AIDS (AI based digital study)
This is the Platform for College Exam Preparation. We known that past papers are the best way to prepare students for the experience of an examination.
You can administer them throughout the year to measure your learners'progression and development
I found that Right Now there are no such Platform for Speciliased branches in YCCE were we get the ALL previous Year Papers .
They are also a great tool for measuring your students' level of understanding and can identify any weaker subject areas,helping you guide your
teaching in line with their needs.
